## True or false: The route handler is middleware ?
### I think its true 

## In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
When we define that inside it

## At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
When we want to apply function on multiple routes

## Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response ``ERROR``
means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header, like callbacks invoked twice for example
