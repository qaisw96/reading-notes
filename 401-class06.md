## Singleton in CS : 
+ A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance
+ helpful usually when a single object is required to coordinate actions across a system

## how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules
```
We need singleton when we want to make sure there is only one object instantiated.
Therefore, instead of creating a new object we need to ensure the constructor was called only once and then we reuse the instance.

Router Middleware | middleware that make end-points that uses HTTP verbs to denote a GET POST DELETE PUT etc requests Router is used to manage these incoming requests. It kind of routes your requests to correct handler/code
Dynamic Module Loading | Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.
Singletone pattern | is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
Mock testing | is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules.



## Bcrypt : 
Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.
