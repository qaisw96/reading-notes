## How do you value your time ?
+ Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour ?

```
Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value,
the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.
```

## what should you do when you encounter a new problem ?
### 1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
### 2. Plan
To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

### 3. Divide
Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

*Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve*

> ### 4. Stuck :
>> Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 
>> Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective
>> Research 


## 5 Whys Technique :
