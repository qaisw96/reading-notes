# JS Functions

```
let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

```
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
```

```
function <function-name>()
{
    // code to be executed
};

//calling a function
<function-name>();
```
