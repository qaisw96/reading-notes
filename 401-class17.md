Term | Defination 
Server Instances |  An instance is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server. If you run two copies of the software on the same physical or virtual server, that counts as two instances. When you run two copies of the software on two different physical or virtual servers, that also counts as two instances. Most disaster‑recovery (DR) deployments require two instances per location, even if one instance is “passive” (running but not receiving traffic).
Cloud Architecture | refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.
