## CombineReducers ::
+ a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers
+ turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

```

If the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer.
According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either
It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.

```


## Arguments
reducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.
