```

Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions,
update the state by calling the root reducer function, 
and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.

```

##  A "side effect"
is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function

+ Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

1. Logging a value to the console
2. Saving a file
3. Setting an async timer
4. Making an AJAX HTTP request
5. Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
6. Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())


``Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.``

## Whatâ€™s a thunk?!
A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.
```
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import rootReducer from './reducers/index';

// Note: this API requires redux@>=3.1.0
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```
