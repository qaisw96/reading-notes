# What is functional programming?
programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and 
avoids changing-state and mutable data

##  pure functions 
+ It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
+ It does not cause any observable side effects



## Higher-order functions
When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
+ takes one or more functions as arguments, or
+ returns a function as its result
