## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.
Framework | Library
--------| ---------
A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need | A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it
tells us what to do. it has the best practice of doing things and provides tooling to support us | Libraries focus only on how to use it, which means that the team doesn’t support libraries for global state management, like HTTP, routing, forms

## SASS
is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
