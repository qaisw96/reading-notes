## Use Reducer :
+ An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.
+ preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. 
+ useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

## useCallback
```

will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components
that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g. shouldComponentUpdate).

```

## useMemo
```

Pass a “create” function and an array of dependencies. useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed.
This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.
