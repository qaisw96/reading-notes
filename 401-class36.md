## Redux 
+ Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions"
+ Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
+ It helps you write applications that behave consistentlyâ€¦
+ Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application
+ transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

``` One application state object managed by one store ```
## An action creator
is a function that creates and returns an action object. We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:

## A reducer 
is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary,
and ```| returns the new state: (state, action) => newState. You can |```


```

Redux is a library for managing global application state
Redux is typically used with the React-Redux library for integrating Redux and React together
Redux Toolkit is the recommended way to write Redux logic
Redux uses a "one-way data flow" app structure
State describes the condition of the app at a point in time, and UI renders based on that state
When something happens in the app:
The UI dispatches an action
The store runs the reducers, and the state is updated based on what occurred
The store notifies the UI that the state has changed
The UI re-renders based on the new state
Redux uses several types of code
Actions are plain objects with a type field, and describe "what happened" in the app
Reducers are functions that calculate a new state value based on previous state + an action
A Redux store runs the root reducer whenever an action is dispatched
