## what Array.map() does ??

### *It creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array*
### Example : 

```
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]

```

## what Array.reduce() does ??
### *reduces the array to a single value, most power thing that it takes a accumlater as a parameter*
### Example : 
```
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue));
// expected output: 10

```

## Superagent :: 
### With normal Promise :
```
const url = `https//##################`

superagent.get(url).then(result => {
  data = result.body
  
  console.log(data) 
})

```
###  with async / await : 
```
async function getDataFromApi() {

    const url = `https//##################`

    const result = await superagent.get(url)
    const data = await result.body

    console.log(data)
}

```

## Promise in short : 
+  simply is a way to handle and organize our function excuting, with promise i can tell  js
``please excute this function and when this function completely finished do the folloing function`` 
+ its useful with functions needs time to excute more than other function which depends on , like when we read data from API for example

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous ??
### No, we can use callback as synchronous or Asynchronous, it depends on sitution that we are in
