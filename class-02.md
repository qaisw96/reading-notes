>> Internal : write rules inside stayle tags in HTML file 
>> External : write rules in CSS page and use link tag to link CSS page in HTML page

## Array 
### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values

```
var color = ["blue", "red", "black"];
```

## EXPRESSIONS
### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions
```
var color = 'beige'; 
var area = 3 * 2; 
```
