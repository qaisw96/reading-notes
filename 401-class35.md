## Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure as a tree that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### some common terminology used when working with Graphs:
```

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

```

## types of Graph :
1. An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

3. A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
