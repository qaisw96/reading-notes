# CSS Layout 

## A Fixed Width Layout :

Fixed Layout Design. A fixed width design is a site that has a standard layout. The width of the site will not change with any screen resolution, browsers are elements on the page. Your web browser can change the zoom size of the page, but the website widths still remain.



## The liquid layout
uses
percentages to specify the width
of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the
screen.
When trying this in your
browser, remember to make the
window smaller and larger.

```
The fixed width layout will stay the same width no matter whatsize the browser window is,
whereas the liquid layout will stretch (or shrink) to fill the
screen

## Grid Layout
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
