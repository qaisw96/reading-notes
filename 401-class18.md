## What are serverless functions?
is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier

## Describe how a CDN works
CDN has stored, on its edge servers, a copy of the black Nike running shoe that we talked about earlier. Even if you change the image on your origin server, the file cached on the CDN won't change automatically. For the same product image, the CDN cache has a different version than the origin server.

## What is Amazon API Gateway?
```
Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and
connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic.
It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

```

## How does API Gateway work?
```
API Gateway integrates with many other AWS services like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools.
These integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers,
as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests.
```

## How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?

+ AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
+ AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
+ Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

## Benefits of Amazon API Gateway
1. Map HTTP requests to specific functions in a Serverless application viaanAPI Gateway event.
2. Map WebSocket events to Serverless functions
3. Save time with integrations: authentication, developer portal, CloudTrail, CloudWatch
