# Search Engine Optimization 
means the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.


## On-Page SEO
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

1. **Page Title**
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the ```<title>``` element which lives
inside the <head> element.

2. **URL / Web Address**
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.

3. **Headings**
If the keywords are in a heading
```<hn>``` element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.


4. **Text**
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times.

5. **Link Text**
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").


6. **Image Alt Text**
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.

7. **Page Descriptions**
The description also lives inside
the ```<head>``` element and is
specified using a <meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page
