## BDD is an evolution of TDD. In TDD : 
developers :  
1. write unit tests and watch them fail, 
2. (2) develop the feature to make the tests pass, 
3. (3) refactor the code to make it stronger
4. (4) repeat the cycle.

## acceptance tests
```
This is a type of testing done by users, customers, or other authorised entities to determine application/software needs and business processes. 
It is also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), operational acceptance testing (OAT), and end-user testing.

```

## setState()
is the only legitimate way to update state after the initial state setup.

## Components 
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here.
