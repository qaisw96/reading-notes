## OAuth
 a way to give users the ability to grant application access to services, without giving the application their password.
 Today, we will be giving our server the ability to "Login as You" at Google and other providers
 
## pros >> 
1. pros It allows you to read data of a user from another application.
2. It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices.
3. Is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.

## cons 
1. Types of authentication factors. Multi-factor authentication is a method that requires users to present several pieces of evidence that confirm identity. ...
2. Factors can get lost. There is no certainty that your authentication factors will be available when you need them. ...
3. False security. ...
4. It can be turned against users.



## How does OAuth work?
Through a series of "handshakes", an application such as an Express Web Server asks the user if it's ok to login as them at some remote service, and then begins the process of authentication and access.

```
Application spawns the "Login Using xxx" window, asking for specific permissions
User Agrees to allow this to happen
Remote service (i.e. Google) contacts the application with a one-time-use Code
The application calls back to a special address on the remote service to exchange that Code for a Token
Once the token has been granted, the application will then be able to contact the remote service, using that Token to access information on behalf of the user
The token is the user

```
