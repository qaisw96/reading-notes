# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team



## As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors :

## FIRST
```

First, on the good teams, **members spoke in roughly the same proportion**, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.
’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment.
But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount.
‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said.
‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

```

## SECOND 
```

the good teams all had **high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’** — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice,
their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people 
are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. 
They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. 
They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

### For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well :

1. like making sure teams had clear goals.
2. creating a culture of dependability. 
3. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.
