## A FIFO queue : 

is a queue that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. This means that the request (like a customer in a store or a print job sent to a printer) is processed in the order in which it arrives.
... In queuing theory, the rule governing queue operation is known as queuing discipline.


SNS | SQS 
-----|------
Puplisher, subscriber system | queueing service for processing messages  
SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism | distributed queuing system
eliminating the need to periodically check or “poll” for updates | Polling inherently introduces some latency in message delivery in SQS

```
SQS cannot publish messages to SNS. SQS can only store the messages.
You have to pull the message using SQS Api's.
```

```
Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues, to build applications that require messages
to be sent and processed in a strict sequence and without duplicates
