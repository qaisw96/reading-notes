# HTML image 

## To add an image into the page you need to use an ``<img>`` elemen 

```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```

## Image properties

property | What does
---------|---------
width | specifies the width of the image in pixels
hight | specifies the height of the image in pixels
align | ndicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image(left & right values )


There are three rules when created an image : 

```
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution
```


```
Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

```

# CSS color 

## Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue

There are many ways to add color to css like :
```
Hexa ========> #55ff88
rgb ========> rgb(100,100,55)
hsl ========> hsl(0,0%,78%)
hsla ========> hsla(0,100%,100%,0.5)
```

Size of Type =======> font-size
For example :

font-size: 12px;}
```



## Text-decoration

>> + none ----> This removes any decoration already applied to the text.
>> + underline ----> This adds a line underneath thetext.
>> + overline ----> This adds a line over the top of the text.
>> + line-through ----> his adds a line through words.
>> + blink ----> This animates the text to make it flash on and off (however this is generally frowned upon, as it is considered rather annoying).
