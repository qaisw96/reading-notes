## React Router v4
 a pure React rewrite of the popular React package
 
+ <BrowserRouter> should be used when you have a server that will handle dynamic requests (knows how to respond to any possible URI),
+ <HashRouter> should be used for static websites (where the server can only respond to requests for files that it knows about).
  
Routes have three props that can be used to define what should be rendered when the route’s path matches : 

1. component — A React component. When a route with a component prop matches, the route will return a new element whose type is the provided React component (created using React.createElement).
2. render — A function that returns a React element 5. It will be called when the path matches. This is similar to component, but is useful for inline rendering and passing extra props to the element.
3. children — A function that returns a React element. Unlike the prior two props, this will always be rendered, regardless of whether the route’s path matches the current location.
