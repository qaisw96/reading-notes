## WHY Hooks ???
+ Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
+ Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
+ Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.

## HOOKS :
+ A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example,
 useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.
+ Hooks let us organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units
+ Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.
+ Reusable code 


## Some Hooks Features :
1. Using the State Hook ==> Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it
2. use effect
3. useContext
