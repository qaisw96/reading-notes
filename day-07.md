# Roy Fielding 
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why 
the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser


## http 
That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.


## Why http ?!!!!!
```
Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

```

## URLs 

+ Tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere.
+ A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. 
+ Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
