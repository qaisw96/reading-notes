## Why is access control important?

It is necessary for an organization to identify the nature of possible threats to its information systems and establish a set of measures, called controls, to ensure their security (and, beyond that, to also ensure the privacy and confidentiality of information stored in the systems).


## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
It allows you to swich roles to gain access to other resourses 


## Authorization : 
gives user permission to access a resourses =â‡’ ARE YOU ALLOWED TO DO THAT ??

## Role Based Access Control : 
a type of access control, it depends on functions or roles in organization for users, depends on user role  the permession to information will be given

## Capabilities : 
is a concept in the design of secure computing systems,  is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority




## Event-Driven Programming :
Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision


## Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

+ An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
+ A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

## example on EDP : 
```
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const chatRoomEvents = new EventEmitter;

function userJoined(username){
  // Assuming we already have a function to alert all users.
  alertAllUsers('User ' + username + ' has joined the chat.');
}

// Run the userJoined function when a 'userJoined' event is triggered.
chatRoomEvents.on('userJoined', userJoined);

```
