## What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
That means the sender can send the data and the reciever can also send the data

## Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP, also http allow us to make rooms by routs for example
