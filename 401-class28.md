is a state management technique. Application State is stored in the memory of the
the server and is faster than storing 
and retrieving information in a database.
Session sate is specific for a single user session, but Application State is for all users and sessions

##  Most Important concepts in REACT 
1. The Component Lifecycle :
it details the life of a component. Like us, components are born, do some things during their time here on earth, and then they die
2. Higher-Order Components
A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
3. State and setState()
takes an object and merges it into the current state. On top of this, there are a few things you should also know about it.
4. React context API 
allows you to create global context objects that can be given to any component you make. This allows you to share data without having to pass props down all the way through the DOM tree.
