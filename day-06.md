+ installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
+  running JavaScript on the server

if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm

are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

2. building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database)
